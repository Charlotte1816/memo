            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Maizuru City is a region rich in history and tradition. It flourished as a strategic hub of maritime transport from ancient times to the medieval era, and during the Edo period it played an important role as a military base under the shogunate and a center of trade. With modernization from the Meiji era, the development of port facilities and industry progressed, rapidly shaping the city. Following post–World War II reconstruction, the city has evolved by preserving its unique culture and history while embracing modernity, becoming a dynamic urban area where diverse cultural and economic activities converge. Historic structures and cultural heritage sites dot the cityscape and are carefully preserved as proud testaments to tradition. Efforts to pass on history through education and tourism further highlight Maizuru City's sustainable development and harmonious blend of the past and the present.</p>
            <p>Maizuru City is characterized by its rich natural surroundings, boasting geographical features encircled by sea and mountains. To the north, it faces the Sea of Japan with a mild climate influenced by ocean currents that nurture a unique ecosystem. Inland, gentle hills and forests spread out, offering picturesque landscapes in every season.</p>

            <h2 id="goro">Goroga-dake Park</h2>
            <p>Goroga-dake Park (Maizuru City) is a natural park located at an altitude of about 300 meters at the summit of Mount Goroga. It features a 50-meter-tall observation tower, the "Goro Sky Tower," whose observation deck sits at 325 meters above sea level, offering a 360-degree panoramic view of Maizuru Bay and the stunning ria coastline.</p>
            <p>
                The park is divided into several areas: "Summit Plaza," "Nahotoka Plaza," "Children's Plaza," "Maple Plaza," and "Pine Plaza." Near the tower, there is a multi-purpose play area and covered benches, making it a secure destination for families.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the Pine Plaza and Maple Plaza, Japanese red pines and maple trees are planted, which display diverse seasonal changes—charming visitors with vivid autumn colors, fresh spring greenery, and even a sea of clouds in winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, the Goro Sky Tower was completed in 1995. Since then, facilities such as the observation cafe "GORO SKY CAFE nanako" and telescopes have been installed, and events like the first sunrise on New Year's Day and autumn sea of clouds observations are regularly held.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Goroga-dake Park is renowned as a breathtaking viewpoint cherished by local residents and tourists. The walking trails along the ridge make it ideal for strolling and picnicking, and the vistas from both the tower and the summit plaza are equally impressive. On clear days, the view can extend towards Mount Oe, evoking a mystical, almost legendary atmosphere.

            <h2 id="maizuru">Maizuru Nature &amp; Culture Park</h2>
            <p>Maizuru Nature &amp; Culture Park is located in the northeastern part of Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture. Developed on the site of the former Seibu Farm and spanning approximately 34.7 hectares, the park features a Camellia Garden in spring, a Hydrangea Garden in early summer, and an Autumn Foliage Garden in fall.</p>
            <p>
                In the spring, about 1,500 varieties and 30,000 camellia plants bloom, transforming the park into a vibrant display of color. Renowned as one of Japan's premier camellia sites, it attracts numerous visitors during the "Camellia Festival." In early summer, roughly 100 varieties and 100,000 hydrangeas burst into bloom across the valley, creating a spectacle often called the "sea of hydrangeas." Both gardens typically open from mid-June to early July, and in autumn, the foliage garden—featuring maples, ginkgo, and other trees—dresses the park in a rich crimson, fully showcasing the charm of late autumn.
            </p>
            <p>
                The park also offers well-maintained walking paths and benches, providing a relaxing environment for families and casual strollers to enjoy nature. Social media posts, especially on Instagram, often feature visitors with their beloved pets, reflecting the park’s pet-friendly atmosphere.

            <h2 id="port">Maizuru Port Sightseeing Boat</h2>
            <p>Maizuru Port Sightseeing Boat is a cruise that takes approximately 35 minutes to navigate Maizuru Bay. Departing from the pier at Akarenka Park, it is available for both groups and individuals, operating from spring through winter (including weekends, holidays, Golden Week, and Obon), with winter services primarily on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.</p>
            <p>
                On board, visitors can observe up-close various vessels of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force—such as an escort ship stationed at the Maizuru Naval Base, minesweepers, and transport ships. Additionally, the cruise offers views of the ria coastline, shipyards, and the crane bridge that echoes the region’s naval heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
                More than just a sea tour, the cruise provides a unique experience where the historical legacy of the former naval port meets modern self-defense vessels, allowing visitors to truly witness the "face of the sea" in Maizuru. It is an appealing attraction for families, history buffs, and photography or videography enthusiasts alike.

            <h2 id="tanabe">Tanabe Castle Ruins</h2>
            <p>Tanabe Castle Ruins (Maizuru Park) were originally built in 1582 during the late Sengoku period by Hosokawa Fujitaka (Yūsai) as his retirement fortress. For nearly 290 years, it served as the residence of the Tango clan. Originally known as "Maizuru Castle," this name is the origin of the modern name, Maizuru City.</p>
            <p>
                Just before the Battle of Sekigahara, Yūsai and over 500 of his guards were besieged for approximately 52 days by Ishida Mitsunari’s army of 15,000. However, Yūsai presented the secret oral tradition of the Kokin Wakashū to Emperor Kōmyō, who, in return, ordered the siege lifted, allowing Yūsai to surrender and withdraw—a dramatic episode now enshrined in legend.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following its decommissioning in the 6th year of Meiji (1873), the main bailey was transformed into a public space known as Maizuru Park. In 1992, the castle gate was reconstructed (with the second floor now serving as the Tanabe Castle Museum), alongside the turret (built in 1940) and the Shōkokan (currently a museum) that evoke the castle’s past. The museum displays artifacts and materials related to Yūsai and subsequent castle lords, including reconstructed models of the castle town and exhibits of armor and swords, allowing visitors to feel the enduring pulse of history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the park, remnants of stone walls, a reconstructed well, the remains of the castle keep, and even a "Kokorone Garden"—named after Yūsai’s poetry—are interspersed throughout. In spring, it is also celebrated as a renowned spot for cherry blossoms. Moreover, recent archaeological excavations have uncovered previously unknown defensive structures, such as the castle’s tiger gate and additional remnants of the stone walls, deepening the understanding of its scale and design.
