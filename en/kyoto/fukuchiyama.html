            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Fukuchiyama City has prospered as a crucial transportation hub since ancient times, serving as an important passage
                connecting coastal routes and mountainous regions. During the Sengoku period, it became the stage for clashes among local feudal lords,
                which spurred the development of distinctive military tactics and defensive strategies. In the Edo period, as the castle town matured,
                vibrant trade and cultural exchanges flourished alongside the emergence of various traditional festivals whose influence continues to this day.
                Following the Meiji Restoration, the waves of the Industrial Revolution led to railway expansions and industrial growth, laying the groundwork
                for a modern city. Today, Fukuchiyama City preserves its historical urban landscapes while integrating contemporary amenities, offering a rich
                blend of attractions for both residents and visitors. The city stands as an essential center for passing local traditions and history to future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fukuchiyama City is characterized by its abundant natural beauty, featuring both lush mountainous areas in the north and expansive plains.
                Here, chains of verdant mountains, interspersed with clear streams and deep valleys, provide a feast for the eyes in every season.

            <h2 id="oeyama">Oeyama Mountain Range</h2>
            <p>
                The Oeyama Mountain Range is located in northern Kyoto Prefecture, straddling the boundary between the Tango and Tanba regions.
                Its main peak, Senjōgatake (832 meters), along with numerous other peaks extending from east to west, has long been revered as a sacred
                mountain imbued with legends and folklore. The name “Oeyama” is said to derive from the expansive appearance of the peaks that blanket the entire mountain,
                and it is also famously known as the fabled residence of the demon Shuten-dōji, whose legend has been passed down since the Heian period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographically, although the elevation of Oeyama is relatively moderate, it occupies a strategic gateway between the Sea of Japan and the inland regions.
                Deep valleys, sheer cliffs, and primeval forests—featuring stands of beech and mizunara oak, as well as the fresh greens of spring and vibrant autumn hues—
                adorn its slopes. Clear streams meander through the mountain, serving as an important water source for the Tango-Tanba area. Well-maintained trails in the area
                invite enthusiasts for hiking, nature observation, and trekking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rich in history and legend, Oeyama is especially renowned as the setting for demon tales. It is said that during the Heian period, the fearsome demon Shuten-dōji
                established his stronghold in these mountains, unleashing havoc until he was cunningly lured and defeated by Minamoto no Yorimitsu and his Four Heavenly Kings—a legendary
                act celebrated for its heroic ingenuity. Today, visitors can still find remnants of these tales in sites such as the rock cave said to have been Shuten-dōji’s lair, the Oni-dake Inari shrine,
                and the “Sword-Washing Pond” where Yorimitsu is believed to have sharpened his blade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, Oeyama has been a revered site for mountain ascetics practicing shugendō. Its rugged trails and precipitous cliffs have long served as natural training grounds,
                with various temples and small shrines dedicated to Fudō Myōō scattered throughout, thereby enhancing its spiritual ambience—a quality that harmoniously intertwines with its legendary past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the Oeyama Mountain Range is cherished both for its stunning natural environment and its rich tapestry of history and myth. Hikers, history buffs, and pilgrims alike are drawn
                to its panoramic views overlooking the Sea of Japan and the surrounding landscapes, where ancient tales continue to whisper amid the mountain air.

            <h2 id="ninesekawa">Ninesekawa Ravine</h2>
            <p>
                Ninesekawa Ravine is nestled deep within the mountainous region of Oe-cho in Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture. Nurtured by the rich natural environment of the Oeyama Mountain Range,
                this scenic spot is renowned for its clear streams and dramatic valley vistas. Originating from springs on the mountainside of Oeyama, the Ninesekawa flows past sheer rock faces and deep gorges, ultimately
                joining the Yura River. The banks are adorned with massive boulders, peculiar rock formations, and waterfalls of varying sizes, while the gentle murmur of the water and the rustle of the trees evoke a sense
                of nature’s mystique and vitality.
            </p>
            <p>
                In spring, the ravine bursts into fresh greenery; in summer, the cool clear waters refresh visitors; in autumn, the foliage transforms into a tapestry of rich colors; and in winter, the snowy landscape creates a serene,
                picturesque scene. Historically enjoyed both as a leisurely retreat and a site for ascetic practices, the ravine is steeped in local legends—one of which suggests that Shuten-dōji and his followers once hid in its caves and rock shelters.
                There is even a saying that the water sometimes appears tinged with red, a lingering reminder of the legendary battles fought here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geologically, Ninesekawa Ravine is a marvel sculpted by the interplay of steep mountains and dense forests. Its dynamic landscape—marked by rapid streams, cascading waterfalls, and deep chasms—reveals moss-covered rocks and a crystal-clear riverbed,
                all of which support a diverse ecosystem integral to the Tango-Tanba region.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the Ninesekawa Ravine is treasured not only as a prime tourist destination but also as a vital natural heritage site that offers visitors a deep sense of tranquility and historical wonder. Its pristine flow and serene valley continue to
                captivate the hearts of all who visit.
            </p>

            <h2 id="yaku">Yaku Basalt Park</h2>
            <p>
                Yaku Basalt Park is located in the Yaku-no-Yakunocho area of Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture. It features a stunning natural landscape formed when the lava from the last eruption—approximately 300,000 to 400,000 years ago
                at Hoson (Tagurayama)—cooled and solidified, giving rise to striking columnar joints. These joints are formed as the lava cools and cracks into hexagonal columns arranged vertically, resembling a grand, naturally sculpted screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the park, these columnar structures extend for approximately 15 meters in height and 150 meters in width, with the underlying lava bed exposed, making the site a geological treasure. Well-maintained walking paths, a shelter, and an observation deck
                allow visitors to safely explore and admire the breathtaking natural artistry.
            </p>
            <p>
                In spring, the park comes alive with the blooming of Somei Yoshino cherry trees, whose delicate blossoms contrast beautifully with the rugged basalt columns—creating scenes reminiscent of a fantastical painting. An 18-meter high artificial waterfall further enhances
                the visual delight, especially during the cherry blossom and fresh green seasons, when the interplay between water and rock is truly mesmerizing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open to the public free of charge, Yaku Basalt Park is celebrated as one of Fukuchiyama’s premier scenic spots. It is also recognized as a designated natural monument by Kyoto Prefecture and named among Kyoto Prefecture’s Natural 200.
                The park is easily accessible via bus from JR Sanin Main Line's Kamiyaku Station or by car via Maizuru Wakasa Road and Fukuchiyama IC along National Route 9, taking approximately 40 minutes. Ample parking further adds to its appeal.

            <h2 id="sandan">Sandan Pond Park</h2>
            <p>
                Sandan Pond Park is an expansive urban park covering approximately 55.9 hectares in Inosaki, Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture. Situated on elevated ground, its centerpiece is a three-tiered pond: the innermost pond spans about 1.3 km in circumference and covers an area of 4.8 hectares,
                with the entire pond complex stretching roughly 3 km. Originally built for irrigation by Fukuchiyama’s feudal lord, Matsudaira Tadabusa, the park shines in every season—cherry blossoms and azaleas in spring, vibrant autumn foliage, and a serene snowy ambience in winter.
                Alongside the graceful pine groves and the charming tea house known as Shofutei, the park offers a perfect blend of natural beauty and historical charm.
            </p>
            <p>
                The park also houses a children’s science museum complete with a planetarium and 360° immersive displays, a zoo featuring kangaroos, Japanese white-handed gibbons, as well as dedicated areas for rabbits and guinea pigs—making it the city’s only zoo.
                Moreover, the botanical garden, commonly known as “Small Terra,” includes a greenhouse with displays of cacti, orchids, and tropical fruits, accompanied by quiz panels that invite visitors to expand their horticultural knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to these attractions, Sandan Pond Park is equipped with multiple sports facilities including a multipurpose gymnasium, a martial arts hall, multi-use grounds, and tennis courts—establishing it as a hub for local sports and events.
                With free parking available for about 1,200 vehicles and its role as the start and finish point of the Fukuchiyama Marathon, the park occupies an integral place in community life.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, Sandan Pond Park stands as a symbol of Fukuchiyama City, celebrated for its harmonious blend of natural splendor, historical landscapes, educational attractions, and recreational facilities that cater to both learning and leisure.

            <h2 id="otonase">Otonase Bridge</h2>
            <p>
                Otonase Bridge is an arched road bridge spanning the Yura River in Inosaki, Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture. This historic bridge has long supported local transportation and community life.
                It is part of Kyoto Prefectural Route 55 (Maizuru-Fukuchiyama Line) and features a 478-meter-long Nielsen-Rose arched design recognized for its graceful curvature,
                which creates a picturesque scene when reflected on the river, especially at sunset.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Yura River, stretching 146 kilometers, was once a thriving waterway that facilitated commerce in the region. The bridge’s name is derived from its proximity to Matsuo Shrine,
                where offerings of fish were associated with the “silent” waters of the river—a name that underscores the calmness of its flow. The bridge has also been immortalized in the lyrics of the Fukuchiyama Ondo,
                making it an enduring emblem of local culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, several bridges have stood at this location. Starting with a temporary wooden plank bridge in 1877, successive wooden bridges were replaced over two to four generations from the late Meiji era to the early Shōwa period,
                often succumbing to flood damage. The current concrete bridge, built as the fifth in its lineage in 1932, was followed by the present sixth-generation structure completed in 1995.
                In recent years, during periods of low water, remnants of the old wooden piers occasionally become visible—a phenomenon that often sparks local conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Otonase Bridge is easily accessible—a 15 to 17-minute walk from Fukuchiyama Station—and is popular as part of scenic drives and walking routes.
                It offers stunning riverside views and seasonal landscapes: the fresh greens of spring, the warm hues of autumn sunsets, and the elegant silhouette of the arch reflected in the water.
