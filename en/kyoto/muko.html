            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Kyoto Prefecture Muko City is a town imbued with a long history and vibrant culture from ancient times. Ancient burial mounds and medieval heritage sites dot the area, exuding a traditional ambiance. In addition, the town developed as a key transportation hub from the Sengoku to Edo periods, influences of which can still be seen in modern festivals and events.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city features gentle hills and expansive plains, with various rivers and clear streams providing nourishment to the region. The transient nature of the seasons is evident; in spring, flowers bloom in abundance and in autumn, the vivid colors of changing leaves create a picturesque scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geologically, layers formed by historic volcanic activity and sedimentation can be observed, and agriculture flourishes with the blessing of abundant groundwater. Furthermore, the coexistence of nature alongside modern development creates a unique landscape where traditional scenery and contemporary conveniences harmoniously merge.

            <h2 id="terado">Terado Ōtsuka Tumulus</h2>
            <p>
                Terado Ōtsuka Tumulus straddles the border between Muko City in Kyoto Prefecture and Nishikyo Ward in Kyoto. Dating from the early Kofun period (mid-4th century), it is an approximately 98-meter-long keyhole-shaped burial mound. Located atop the Otokun Hill, its rear circular portion is built in three tiers with a diameter of about 54–57 meters and a height of around 10 meters, while the front rectangular part is constructed in two tiers with a width of roughly 45 meters. The slopes are adorned with roofing stones, and numerous cylindrical and morning-glory–shaped haniwa were once placed on the mound’s top and flat areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both the rear circular and front sections feature vertical pit stone chambers. The chamber in the rear, constructed using Nishiyama stone, measures approximately 6.45 meters in length, 0.85 meter in width, and about 1.6 meters in height. The front chamber is around 5.3 meters long, 0.9 meter wide, and 1 meter high, and both housed a rich collection of grave goods such as mirrors, weapons, tools, and ornaments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the excavated items is a mirror with triangular edging, made using the same casting method as one from the Tsuboi Ōtsuka Yama Tumulus in Kizugawa City, suggesting collaboration among local chieftains and offering insights into the political structure of the era. Additionally, iron swords, axes, sickles, and various tools along with ornaments such as magatama and tubular beads were discovered, providing valuable evidence of the local elite’s lifestyle during the early Kofun period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent surveys have revealed that the western side of the front portion opens outward, confirming that the mound’s shape is different from the previously assumed "mirror shape."
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the rear circular portion is overgrown with mixed trees while the front is enveloped by bamboo groves, visible along the nearby "Bamboo Trail." Excavations have been conducted intermittently since 1923, with the most recent studies taking place from the 2000s through 2012.

            <h2 id="nagaokakyo">Nagaokakyo</h2>
            <p>
                Nagaokakyo, located at the southwestern end of the Kyoto Basin, is the site of Japan's ancient capital. In 784, Emperor Kanmu, seeking to overcome the geographical and religious limitations of the previous capital, decided to relocate to Otsukun—an area encompassing present-day Muko City, Nagaokakyo, Oyamazaki Town, and Nishikyo Ward—thanks to its convenient water and land transportation and its ties with immigrant clans. Construction of the new capital began in June of the 3rd year (784) and by the following year, major structures such as the great hall and the palace had been completed, establishing the new metropolis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The capital spanned approximately 4.3 km east to west and 5.3 km north to south, featuring advanced urban functions including grid planning, drainage systems, residential wells, and cattle cart channels. Archaeological excavations have confirmed that this capital was not merely legendary but did indeed exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the new capital was short-lived. In the 7th year, after the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, a series of calamities—including epidemics, natural disasters, and the deaths of imperial family members—plagued Nagaokakyo, earning it a reputation as a cursed city haunted by vengeful spirits. Consequently, in the 13th year (794), Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), leaving Nagaokakyo as the capital for only about ten years. Afterwards, the area reverted to civilian use and its ruins lay undiscovered for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1954, archaeological discoveries in Muko City uncovered remnants of ancient palace sites and other key structures, sparking one of the largest-scale excavation projects with over 2,500 digs. Investigations confirmed the remains of the imperial palace, great hall, and administrative areas, which are now preserved as national historic sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographically, Nagaokakyo was designed with a harmonious blend of gentle hills and rivers, with the Katsura, Uji, and Kizu (Yodo) Rivers converging nearby. To the south were ports (such as Yamazaki-tsu) and logistical hubs including irrigation channels and cattle cart roads, while the northwest featured sophisticated drainage systems harnessing natural springs. This innovative urban design greatly influenced the later construction of Heian-kyō.
            </p>
            <p>
                Folklore recounts that following the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu and a succession of misfortunes—including epidemics and the deaths of the Empress and Crown Prince—a divination by an onmyoji attributed these calamities to vengeful spirits, which in turn motivated the relocation of the capital. Although Fujiwara no Tanetsugu was also a local figure with significant influence over the capital’s development, his assassination has come to symbolize the brief lifespan of the capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Nagaokakyo thrives as a cultural city that leverages its rich historical heritage; locally, the annual Garasha Festival held in November commemorates Hosokawa Garasha of the nearby Katsuryu-ji Castle, preserving a continuous link with its past.

            <h2 id="muko-jinja">Muko Shrine</h2>
            <p>
                Muko Shrine, located in the northern part of Muko City in Kyoto Prefecture, is an ancient shrine traditionally said to have been founded in the 2nd year of Yōrō (718). It is mentioned in the Engishiki Jinmyōchō as either "Muko Shrine" or "Hiraikami Shrine," underscoring its longstanding significance as an official Shinto sanctuary. Originally, two separate shrines were enshrined on Muko Hill (approximately 60 meters in elevation): the upper shrine (Muko Shrine, guardian of abundant harvests) and the lower shrine (Hiraikami Shrine, patron of rain and fire control). In the early medieval period, the lower shrine fell into disrepair, and in 1275 the deities were merged into the present institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enshrined deities include Toshigami (Muko, patron of abundant harvests), Hiraikami Ōkami (praying for rain and controlling fires), Tamayorihime, and even Emperor Jimmu. The shrine’s crest, featuring a hollyhock design (originally a two-leaf version), is traditionally associated with the Tokugawa clan.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main hall, built in the Muromachi period in 1422 (Ōei 29) in the Sangam-shin architectural style, has been designated an Important Cultural Property in the Heisei era. Its gracefully flowing roof is said to have inspired the design of the main hall at Meiji Jingu, and it is highly regarded as an exemplar of shrine architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                The shrine’s approach is paved with stone and lined with cherry and maple trees, forming a tunnel-like vista that dazzles during the spring cherry blossom festival and the autumn foliage season.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deeply rooted in the local community, Muko Shrine hosts traditional ceremonies throughout the year: a cherry blossom festival in April, a divine procession and homecoming festival on the second Sunday of May, a summer purification ritual at the end of July, and a bonfire festival in October.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographically, the shrine sits on elevated ground at the southern edge of Muko Hill, offering a panoramic view of the confluence of the Katsura, Uji, and Kizu Rivers. This strategic location is linked to the origin of the name "Muko" and historically spurred the development of townships along ancient highways connecting Kyoto to western regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, ancient tombs—including the moto-inari kofun—and other burial groups dot the area to the south of the shrine, reflecting a history where faith and martial traditions have intertwined since antiquity, further associating the region with the name "Muko."
