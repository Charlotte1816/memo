            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Kameoka City has flourished as an important transportation hub since ancient times. In early history, its strategic location—encircled by mountains and rivers—provided the basis for local residents to benefit from nature and made it the center of community life. During the Sengoku period, the city’s geography was utilized in various military conflicts, and in the Edo period it prospered as a post town where commerce and culture thrived. In modern times, the fusion of tradition and innovation has opened new paths for cultural and regional revitalization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kameoka City is located in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture. Its terrain features a blend of abundant natural beauty and a rich historical background. Surrounded by mountains and traversed by clear streams, the area forms a picturesque scene that shifts gracefully with the seasons. Expansive flat farmlands also bear testimony to a long history of agriculture that skillfully utilized local water resources.

            <h2 id="hozu">Hozukyo</h2>
            <p>
                Hozukyo (in Kameoka City) is a scenic area that spans the Hozu River canyon from Kameoka in Kyoto Prefecture to the Togetsukyo Bridge in Arashiyama, Kyoto City. Geographically, approximately 2 to 5 million years ago, tectonic uplift and subsidence formed the ancient Kameoka Lake, which was later carved into a steep canyon by erosion. The result is a dramatic landscape featuring rock walls that rise up to 25 meters along with unique rock formations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early Edo period (around 1606), boat transport was initiated by Kakurakura Ryoi for timber and other goods. High-speed boats known as Takase boats began to navigate the rapids and massive rocks. By 1885, sightseeing river cruises became popular, transitioning from a mode of transport to an experience in leisure. Hozukyo has captured the imagination of literary figures including Natsume Soseki and Yukio Mishima, who featured its scenery in their works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each season offers its own beauty: In spring, approximately 2,000 yamazakura and Somei Yoshino trees line the valley, creating a stunning cherry blossom tunnel enjoyed by both sightseeing boats and cog trains. Early summer brings fresh greenery; in June, iwatsutsuji burst into delicate bloom on the rocky slopes. In autumn, the canyon is set ablaze with the red hues of momiji, maples, and ginkgo trees, reaching their peak in mid-November to early December.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tourism in Hozukyo includes a 16 km boat cruise from Kameoka to Saga Arashiyama, navigated by skilled boatmen on hand-powered vessels, offering both thrill and scenic splendor. Alternatively, the Sagano Scenic Railway runs a 7.3 km tour along the canyon, allowing passengers to admire the view from the train windows.

            <h2 id="anaotera">Anaotera Temple</h2>
            <p>
                Anaotera Temple is an ancient temple of the Tendai sect located on a gentle hill in Sogabe Town within Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture. Officially known as Bodaizan Anaotera, the temple is said by legend to have been founded in 705 (Keiun 2) by Otohira Furumaro at the behest of Emperor Monmu, with Yakushi Nyorai as the principal image. Later, accepting the veneration of Holy Avalokiteshvara, the temple became the 21st site among the 33 sacred sites of western Japan. During the Kamakura period, the famed priest Ippen resided here, and in the Muromachi period it received land grants from the shogunate, establishing it as a central spiritual site in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographically, Anaotera is positioned between the Hozu River canyon and the Kameoka Basin, sometimes referred to as the "Gateway to Deep Arashiyama." On its peaceful elevated site, a small stream and vibrant greenery create an environment of calm and serenity for visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the temple grounds are the Niomon gate (rebuilt in the mid-Edo period), the main hall, a pagoda, and En’o-in, among others. The main hall (rebuilt in 1745) is an impressive hip-and-gable structure with five bays, its ornate ceiling adorned with bird-and-flower paintings. The pagoda (rebuilt in 1804) features sculptures of the Four Heavenly Kings and the Four Symbols on each of its four pillars, and the entire temple complex is registered as a cultural property by Kyoto Prefecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                The temple’s most notable attractions are the two sacred images: the "Substitute Kannon" enshrined in the main hall—associated with a legend from texts such as the "Konjaku Monogatari" and "Fusō Ryakki" about an arrow incident—and the life-sized wooden statue of Shaka Nyorai discovered in the ceiling in 1894, known as the "Caressing Buddha." Touching the area of the statue corresponding to one’s ailment is believed to confer healing, attracting many faithful visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The temple garden is also a highlight. Designed during the Edo period by Gyokko Rokujō, it is a pond-view style garden that incorporates the pagoda as borrowed scenery. The garden in front of En’o-in is designated as one of Kyoto Prefecture’s famous scenic spots, where the blend of seasonal beauty and tranquil sunsets offers a peaceful retreat.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the graves of Ujimiyashige, a recitation hall, and a Jizo hall distributed throughout the grounds, the temple complex itself is a palimpsest of history. Despite the setback in 1968 when the sacred Kannon statue was stolen, the enduring faith of its visitors has never waned, and the temple’s structures and gardens remain highly valued as regional cultural assets.

            <h2 id="kuwayama">Kuwayama Shrine</h2>
            <p>
                Kuwayama Shrine is an ancient shrine located in Kamiyadacho, Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture. Tradition holds that it was founded in the 2nd year of the Wado era (709). The deities enshrined here are Onamuchi-no-Mikoto (also known as Ōkuninushi) and Homutawake-no-Mikoto (associated with Emperor Ojin), with Onamuchi particularly revered as the deity who pioneered the development of Tanba.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to legend, when the southern part of the Kameoka Basin was once a marshy lake known as "Tan no Ike," Onamuchi along with eight other deities cleared the gorge using shovels and spades, channeling water into Hozukyo to create fertile paddy fields. The mound of shovels supposedly accumulated during this effort gave the shrine its name, "Kuwayama."
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographically, the shrine is situated on the eastern foothills of Omokoyama, linking the Kameoka Basin with Hozukyo. Its precincts house two main halls—Kuwayama-gu and Hachiman-gu—both registered as cultural properties of Kyoto Prefecture. The surrounding area is lined with around 1,000 maple trees, which in autumn set the grounds ablaze with vibrant red hues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, the shrine is mentioned in the Engishiki as “Tanba no Kusa-gun Kuwayama Shrine,” recognized as an esteemed shrine from ancient times. Many traditions also recount the involvement of figures such as Minamoto no Yorimasa and the long-established local administrative records concerning the shrine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The shrine is additionally famed for the "Akamomiji Tunnel," a popular autumn leaf viewing spot where visitors pass under a vermillion torii and ascend moss-covered stone steps, all immersed in the beauty of fall.

            <h2 id="izumo">Izumo Taisha</h2>
            <p>
                Izumo Taisha is located in Chitosecho, Kameoka City, and is recognized as one of Tanba’s principal shrines—a meishin taisha. Tradition holds that it was founded in the 2nd year of the Wado era (709) and that its main hall was built during the Kamakura period, later receiving repairs from figures such as Ashikaga Takauji. The hall is now designated as a nationally important cultural property.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deities enshrined are Onamuchi-no-Mikoto, revered as a god of matchmaking, and his consort, Mihotsuhime-no-Mikoto. Known as "Moto Izumo" or the "Thousand-Year Shrine," the sacred object is the back of Mount Mikage (also called Sennen-zan), where stones and water are believed to be imbued with spiritual energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographically, the shrine is located in the northeastern part of the Kameoka Basin, at the foot of a gentle mountain near the Hozu River, enveloped by a quiet valley. Within its grounds are found the Sennen-zan torii, shrine name plaques, and a spring known as “Manai no Mizu,” from which long lines of visitors come to draw its celebrated water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Countless legends surround the shrine. The 236th passage of the Kamakura-period classic "Tsurezuregusa" notes, "In Tanba there lies a place called Izumo, where a magnificent shrine was erected," attesting to its ancient significance. In addition, the "Tanba Kokufudoki" records that during the Wado era the enshrined deity was once transferred to Kizuki in Shimane Prefecture, casting a mysterious light on the relationship between Izumo Taisha and Izumo Grand Shrine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also featured within the shrine grounds are symbols of unity such as the "Couple Rock" and subsidiary shrines where various blessings are invoked. Every fourth Sunday of the month, the "Enmusubi Festival" is held, featuring rituals in which red threads are tied—a ceremony that attracts many, especially women praying for a successful marriage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, the “Manai no Mizu” is famed as a natural spring water emerging through ancient limestone layers, celebrated both for its health benefits and its reputed longevity, drawing those who seek healing and a long life.
