            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Miyazu City is a historic city that has flourished as a vital transportation and trade hub since ancient times.
                It developed as a relay station on trade routes through the Seto Inland Sea, becoming a crossroads for diverse cultures and religions.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the Edo period, under the influence of the Mori clan, agriculture and maritime transport flourished,
                fostering traditional crafts and local festivals. This culture, harmonizing tradition with its natural setting, remains deeply rooted in the lives of its residents.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern times, with the development of industry and urban planning, historic buildings and modern culture have continued to coexist.
                Today, preserved relics and festivals convey Miyazu City's history and charm to visitors from around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Located in northern Kyoto Prefecture, Miyazu City features a mild climate facing the Seto Inland Sea and a rich natural environment.
                The harmony between its beautiful coastline and mountain scenery, along with historic temples and local traditions,
                offers visitors a unique and captivating experience.

            <h2 id="amano">Amanohashidate</h2>
            <p>
                 Amanohashidate, located in northern Kyoto Prefecture’s Miyazu City, is a sandbar approximately 3.6 km long and ranging from 20 to 170 m wide.
                 The picturesque scene of white sands and about 8,000 pine trees, known as “White Sand, Green Pines,” has long been celebrated
                 as one of Japan’s three most scenic views (alongside Matsushima and Itsukushima).
            </p>
            <p>
                 Its formation is attributed to sand and gravel deposits carried by coastal currents about 6,000 to 4,000 years ago from the eastern coast of the Tango Peninsula.
                 According to the ‘Tango Fudoki’, it is said that the ladder built by Izanagi-no-Mikoto to meet Izanami-no-Mikoto fell, forming the sandbar.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Historically, Amanohashidate appears in the “Tango Kokufudoki” during the Nara period, and during the Muromachi period, Sesshū’s work “Amanohashidate-zu”
                 was designated a national treasure. In the Edo period, noted figures such as Hayakagehō and Kaibara Ekken celebrated it,
                 with even a poem by Koshikibu no Naishi in the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu paying tribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                 As a tourist attraction, the southern Amanohashidate View Land and northern Kasamatsu Park serve as popular observation points.
                 When viewed from between the legs in a practice known as “Matano-zoki,” the sandbar appears like a dragon ascending into the sky,
                 earning the names “Flying Dragon View” and “Rising Dragon View.” Together with the “One-Character View” and “Sesshū View,” these four viewpoints define Amanohashidate.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Nearby, temples such as Chionji and Motoise Kago Shrine, and the famed “Iso Kiyomizu” (selected as one of Japan’s top 100 waters by the Ministry of the Environment) add to the allure.
                 Coupled with local seafood cuisine (including Tango Guji and Tango Beef) and craft experiences, the area seamlessly blends nature, spirituality, and culinary traditions.

            <h2 id="kanbiki">Kanbiki Falls</h2>
            <p>
                 Kanbiki Falls, located in Takiba of Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a magnificent bifurcated waterfall with a drop of about 40 meters and a width of approximately 20 meters.
                 The streams, splitting into a right “male fall” and a left “female fall,” along with the smaller Garyū and Hakuryū Falls, are collectively known as “Kanbiki Falls.”
            </p>
            <p>
                 Geologically, the falls have developed along the rocky faces of local Miyazu granite (biotite granite) and granodiorite.
                 Its smooth, wide cascade earned it a place among Japan’s top 100 waterfalls. Despite its proximity to urban areas, its abundant water flow remains steady year-round.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Historically, the mountain Kanbiki-san (also known as Daimonsan) has been referenced in poetry since the Heian period and was revered as a sacred site in Shingon Esoteric Buddhism,
                 with affiliated temples such as Noganji and Isekiin’s subsidiary. Tradition holds that it was founded in 1049 by a priest of Emperor Kōkei,
                 and records indicate that during the Edo period, Lord Honjō of the Miyazu domain used it as a training ground for his retainers – a period from which the custom of “Taki Soba” is said to have originated.
            </p>
            <p>
                 In addition, local folklore tells of a “fire festival” where, during the late Edo period, locals suffering under harsh rule prayed to Kanbiki Fudō,
                 vanquishing red ogres with divine arrows so that the falls would burst into flames.
                 Today, the “Kanbiki Falls Fire Festival” is held on the last Sunday of July, featuring flaming arrows, priestess dances, and taiko performances.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Geographically, the falls are positioned on the eastern foothills of Kanbiki-san (265 m above sea level) along the upper reaches of the Takiba River.
                 A shallow plunge pool and sandy riverbed allow visitors to enjoy the mist and even play in the water.
                 Facing east, rainbows often form in the morning, and nearby shrines like the North-Facing Jizō and Fudō-in,
                 along with the mossy rocks and lush greenery, create a serene atmosphere.
            </p>

            <h2 id="seya">Seya</h2>
            <p>
                 The Seya district is a secluded mountain village situated at the northern edge of Kyoto Prefecture in the central Tango Peninsula,
                 and is now part of Miyazu City. Originally, during the Edo period, the area comprised Kami-Seya and Shimo-Seya villages.
                 The gently sloping terrain, primarily composed of shale, served as stable agricultural land.
            </p>
            <p>
                 From the early modern period through the Meiji era, the community was known for its production of firewood and charcoal,
                 as well as for shipping preserved agricultural products. Handicrafts such as wisteria weaving and traditional papermaking also provided crucial income during the off-season.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Recognized for its authentic rural landscape – selected among “100 Villages of Japan” and “30 Satoyama Villages of Japan” –
                 the undulating terraced rice fields and traditional thatched or tin-roofed houses are backed by beech and mizunara oak secondary forests,
                 reflecting a way of life in harmony with nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Traditional crafts persist in Seya, with wisteria weaving designated as an intangible folk cultural asset of Kyoto Prefecture and papermaking transmitted through collaborations between local artisans and the city,
                 often through hands-on experiences. Since the 2010s, young immigrants and creative professionals have also moved in,
                 establishing papermaking studios, craft breweries, and even engaging in game meat hunting—efforts that help bridge Seya’s tradition with its future.

            <h2 id="yura">Yura Shrine</h2>
            <p>
                 Yura Shrine is an ancient shrine located in Miyamoto, Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture, once ranked among the prestigious government shrines.
                 Although its exact founding date is unknown, local legend holds that it was originally enshrined at the foot of Mount Yura,
                 and later a branch spirit of Susanoo-no-Mikoto was transferred from Kumano Taisha of Yatsumo in Izumo Province.
            </p>
            <p>
                 The deities enshrined here are Izanagi-no-Mikoto, Kushimikoto-no-Mikoto, and Hokatabetsu-no-Mikoto.
                 During the Edo period, it was venerated by the Tango lords and experienced prosperity in parallel with the flourishing Yura port,
                 earning the nickname “Yura Minato Senken Chōja” (the well-to-do magnate of Yura Port). Originally, the shrine was divided into three areas (Upper, Middle, and Lower),
                 but it was unified into a single shrine in 1711 (Shōtoku era) and came to be known as one of the three Kumano shrines.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Today the shrine is unmanaged with its priestly duties handled by the clergy of Wakimiya Shrine in Miyazu City.
                 The shrine is affectionately regarded as the guardian shrine of the Miyamoto, Hamanoji, and Minato districts,
                 and its annual celebration – the Yura Festival – is held on the second Sunday of October.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Geographically, Yura Shrine is located on the western shore of the Yura River estuary, within walking distance of Yura Station.
                 Along the approach, vistas open up with Mount Yura forming a majestic backdrop.
                 The shrine symbolizes the deep bond between the land where sea, mountains, and river converge.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Within its grounds, visitors can find memorials such as a tablet honoring the Western studies scholar and Dutch physician Shingū Ryōtei,
                 as well as a carved stone commemorating the naval vessel “Yura,” a site popular among fans of the game “Kantai Collection.”
                 These artifacts reflect an intersection of history, culture, and modern-day beliefs.
            </p>
            <p>
                 In addition to its annual festival, there is an event in February – reputedly the oldest bad-luck-cleansing ritual in the Tango region,
                 in which participants pass through a ring made of straw. At the October festival, traditional performances such as kagura dances and coordinated rituals by the shrine community take place.

            <h2 id="tango">Tango Kokubunji Ruins</h2>
            <p>
                 The Tango Kokubunji Ruins are the remains of a “Kokubun-ji” temple established during the Nara period (741)
                 as part of Emperor Shōmu’s national protection measures – formally named “Kinkōmyō Shitennō Gokoku no Tera.”
                 Located on a plateau in Miyazu City with a view of Amanohashidate below, it was once considered the “flower of the nation.”
            </p>
            <p>
                 Initially, the complex boasted a seven-story pagoda and an expansive temple compound.
                 However, with the decline of the ritsuryō state, it fell into ruin.
                 It was later revived from the late Heian through the Kamakura period, as evidenced by excavated tiles and ceramics displaying its former splendor.
                 Although it burned down again toward the end of the Kamakura period, the monk Senki from Yamato Saitai led its reconstruction.
                 In later eras, even after relocating the temple to a nearby elevated area following another fire during the Edo period,
                 a ceremonial lantern remained to mark its legacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Today, the site displays foundation stones of the main hall and pagoda dating from the Kamakura to Nanboku-chō periods,
                 revealing a temple layout characteristic of the Hōki-ji style. Remnants from the original Nara period coexist,
                 offering a living connection from its inception through medieval times.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Known locally as the “Tenpyō View,” the panorama of Amanohashidate seen from the plateau was once extolled by visiting monks.
                 Similarly, Sesshū’s masterpiece “Amanohashidate-zu” depicts the temple and its five-story pagoda in an arrangement that closely mirrors the current ruins.
            </p>
            <p>
                 According to local tradition, legends of benevolent demons also surround the ruins.
                 In the Kamakura period, kind-hearted demons who helped rebuild the temple by taking human form left behind masks and the “Demon Stone.”
                 These remnants are now preserved in the local history museum, and during Setsubun, a fire ritual is still performed in their honor.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Geographically, the site is located at Miyazu City, kokuzen 793, and spans an area measuring 243 meters north–south and 248 meters east–west.
                 Recognized as a national historic site, it lies adjacent to the Kyoto Prefectural Tango Folklore Museum where excavated artifacts and related materials are exhibited.
