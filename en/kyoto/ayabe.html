            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Ayabe City has thrived since ancient times as a crossroads of transportation and culture where the abundant natural environment and water transport combined to boost both economic and cultural development. In ancient times, this area served as an important strategic point, and throughout the Middle Ages its cultural and political significance was reinforced through interactions with surrounding regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the Edo period, Ayabe City was developed as a transportation hub, attracting merchants and cultural figures from afar. Local industries and traditional crafts flourished, and festivals as well as customs became deeply ingrained in the community’s identity. Following the Industrial Revolution, the city continued to modernize while also striving to preserve its historical heritage, growing into a place where tradition and innovation coexist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Ayabe City aspires to be a progressive city that embraces modern technology and culture while cherishing its rich traditions. Its unique culture, rooted in its historical background, deeply moves visitors and remains a strong source of identity for its residents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Located in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture, Ayabe City boasts a terrain that is a treasure trove of natural beauty, with rolling hills and deep valleys. The clear streams flowing through the city and the surrounding forests have long provided a foundation for agriculture and water transport. Additionally, the distinct changes in season — from the fresh greens of spring, to the lush mountains of summer, the vivid autumn colors, and the snowy winter landscapes — each add their own unique charm.

            <h2 id="komyoji">Komyoji Temple</h2>
            <p>
                Komyoji Temple (Ayabe City) is an ancient temple of the Shingon sect Daigo school. It is known by its mountain name, Kimiwaza-yama, and its principal image is Senju Kannon. Tradition holds that it was founded by Prince Shotoku during the reign of Empress Suiko, later revived by En no Ozunu—the founder of Shugendō—and further developed as an esoteric training hall by Rigen Daishi Seihō, a disciple of Kūkai and the founding figure of Daigo-ji. Since the Heian period, it has flourished as a sacred site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nio Gate, constructed in 1248 (Hōji 2) during the Kamakura period, is a rare example of the Irimoya-zukuri and Kusu-buki style double gate. It is the only national treasure of its kind in northern Kyoto Prefecture. The Kongorikish statue enshrined within—crafted by Higo Jotei—was designated an Important Cultural Property in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the temple complex suffered repeated burnings during the Warring States period, the Nio Gate miraculously remained intact, preserving its original form. The main hall was rebuilt in 1836 (Tenpō 7) and now boasts imposing dimensions with elegant transom carvings, making it one of the finest Shingon main halls in northern Kinki.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notable also are the seasonal landscapes along the approach, including autumn foliage and clusters of Shaga blooming near the stone steps. Situated on a mountainside, the temple is embraced by fresh green in spring and bordered by deep red maple leaves in autumn, while in early winter a mystical sea of clouds envelops the mountains.

            <h2 id="ume">Ayabe Plum Grove Park</h2>
            <p>
                Ayabe Plum Grove Park is located in Tate-cho, Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture. Covering approximately 1.5 hectares, around 450 to 460 plum trees are planted throughout the park, making it a popular spot renowned for its stunning spring scenery. A well-maintained circular path of about 820 meters lets visitors stroll among a variety of plum species—including white, red, Nanataka, Uguisu-yadori, and Gyokuei—that offer rich aromas and vibrant colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, the flowering season occurs from late February to mid-March; however, in 2025 the park will be open from March 3rd through 31st, and on March 16th a local community-organized "Plum Festival" is scheduled. The festival will include ceremonies, alfresco dining, live performances ranging from koto to jazz bands, bingo games, food stalls, and food trucks, ensuring that visitors enjoy both the blossoms and a lively spring atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the evenings, the trees are illuminated to create a magical 'night plums' scene, reminiscent of nighttime cherry blossoms. Additionally, from June to July, after the flowers have faded, a plum picking experience is organized so visitors can enjoy the fruit itself.

            <h2 id="obata">Obata Castle Ruins</h2>
            <p>
                Obata Castle Ruins is the remains of a Sengoku period mountain castle built on a hill in Obata-cho, Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture. Perched atop a hill approximately 103 meters high, the main enclosure is strategically located, with a moat cutting off a ridge to the north and earthen ramparts encircling the site—a typical feature of medieval fortresses. The main enclosure measures about 50 meters in length and 20 meters in width, and on the southern side, an Inari shrine is enshrined; the current path up the hill also serves as its approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is said that the castle was governed by the Houkabe clan during the late Sengoku period and fell in 1579 (Tenshō 7) during Akechi Mitsuhide’s campaign in Tanba. At that time, the wife of a member of the Shiomi clan from Fukuchiyama or Inosaki Castle, while attempting to escape, was slain at Misaka Pass—a tragic event known as "The Tale of the Misaka Courtesan," which remains deeply linked to this location.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ruins retain clear remnants of the concentric enclosures, moats, and earthen ramparts, and historical castle seals have been installed in the museum and on site, making it a popular destination for history enthusiasts. In spring, cherry blossoms and Mitsubatsutsuji bloom, and the quiet, green-wrapped main enclosure provides a serene reminder of the interwoven nature and history experienced throughout the seasons. Overall, Obata Castle Ruins is a valuable historical site where the Sengoku history of the Tanba region merges with rural cultural traditions, ideal for both leisurely strolls and educational visits.

            <p>
                Ayabe Interactive Farm is an experiential farm located in Hie, Itada-cho, Ayabe City. Spread over approximately 34 hectares of expansive natural surroundings, the farm offers visitors an opportunity to interact with animals such as goats, sheep, rabbits, and miniature pigs that roam freely in designated feeding and interaction areas. From spring through autumn, seasonal flowers like strawberry candlestick, sunflowers, and cosmos add a colorful charm that enchants every visitor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The on-site restaurant, “Heidi’s Kitchen,” serves dishes made with local ingredients, featuring highlights such as grilled Tanba beef, wild game, and soft serve ice cream. The outdoor barbecue facility is covered and fully equipped so guests need not bring anything, and the glamping facilities—with heating and cooling—ensure that everyone from beginners to seasoned campers can have an enjoyable experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the farm offers a variety of activities such as horseback riding experiences, buggy rides, Heidi’s swing, and a dog run. At the cat farm, rescued cats reside, and visitors can interact with them while making donations to support their care.
